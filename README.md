Introduction
-------------
   The Caesar cipher is a classic example of ancient cryptography and is said to have been used by Julius Caesar.  
   The Caesar cipher is based on transposition and involves shifting each letter of the plaintext message by a certain number of letters.  
   The ciphertext can be decrypted by applying the same number of shifts in the opposite direction.   
   This type of encryption is known as a substitution cipher, due to the substitution of one letter for another in a consistent fashion.

Features
-------------
- ***Substitution cipher*** : Each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
- ***Fixed key*** : The number of positions by which the letters are shifted is the key known to both the sender and the receiver.
- ***Symmetric encryption*** : The same key is used for both encryption and decryption.
- ***Limited keyspace*** : A very limited keyspace of only 26 possible keys, as there are only 26 letters in the English alphabet.
- ***Vulnerable to brute force attacks*** : It is vulnerable to brute force attacks, as there are only 26 possible keys to try.
- ***Easy to implement*** : Very easy to implement and requires only simple arithmetic operations, making it a popular choice for simple encryption tasks.
